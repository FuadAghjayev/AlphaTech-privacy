    <h1>Privacy Policy — AlphaTech Plotter</h1>
    <p class="meta">Last updated: October 10, 2025</p>
  </header>

  <p class="lead">This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>AlphaTech Plotter</strong> (the “App”) handles information. The App is developed and provided by AlphaTech.</p>

  <section>
    <h2>1. App Purpose</h2>
    <p>AlphaTech Plotter helps users access a large collection of mobile device screen dimensions across many phone brands and models, and export those layouts to a printer to plan cutting operations. The App runs primarily on-device and is designed for offline usage.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>2. Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
    <p>The App does not request, collect, or store personal data from users. Specifically, the following items are <strong>not</strong> collected by the App:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Full name or personal identifiers</li>
      <li>Email addresses (unless provided via user-initiated contact outside the App)</li>
      <li>Location data (GPS)</li>
      <li>Photos, media, or files from your device</li>
      <li>Device identifiers (IMEI, advertising ID, or similar)</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>3. Printing & System Services</h2>
    <p>AlphaTech Plotter may invoke your device’s printing functionality to send layout data to a connected printer. Printing is initiated explicitly by the user and handled by the device’s native print framework or a third-party print service installed on the device. The App does not retain a copy of printed content or log print activity.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The App does not transmit user data to third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services. Because it is designed for on-device use, internet connectivity is not required for core features. If you choose to contact the developer via email, that communication occurs through your email provider and is outside the scope of this policy.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
    <p>Since the App does not collect or store personal information, there is no user data stored by AlphaTech Plotter. Any temporary data used for rendering layouts or preparing print jobs remains on the device and is cleared when the App or the print workflow ends.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>6. Children</h2>
    <p>The App is not designed for children under 13 and does not knowingly collect information from children.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>7. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When significant changes are made, we will update the date at the top of this page. Continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance of the revised policy.</p>
  </section>
